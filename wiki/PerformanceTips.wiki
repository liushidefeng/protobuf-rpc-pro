How to get the most performance out of protobuf-rpc-pro.

= Netty =

Since protobuf-rpc-pro uses Netty to provide the io over TCP, optimization of Netty will help increase performance. Here is a good article giving ideas how to squeeze the most out of Netty. [http://gleamynode.net/articles/2232/]

JVM options
* -server -Xms2048m -Xmx2048m -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+UseFastAccessorMethods

Using the JVM options described increased throughput by 15% under certain conditions`*`.

= protobuf-rpc-pro configuration =

If you do not call a client RPC method from within the processing of a server side RPC call then configure your server side DuplexTcpServerBootstrap with a SameThreadExecutor. This can increase the throughput by 25%`*`, since the thread context switching is avoided.

`*` - for calls which require basically no processing time on the server side.
